# Android-TV-UI-Kit

Hey guys! If you are interested in designing apps for Android TV, I‘ve created this UI Kit Sketch file for you.

It’s based on the screenshots from the [Android TV Design guidelines](https://www.google.com/design/spec-tv/android-tv/introduction.html).

Feel free to download, use it in your projects, share with your coworkers!
